# lmerTest - Tests in Linear Mixed Effects Models

## Main features

- Provides _p_-values for `summary` _t_-tests and `anova` _F_-tests for `lmer`-objects (class `merMod`) from the **lme4** package
- Degrees-of-freedom for _t_ and _F_-tests are based on Satterthwaite's method
- Provides Type III ANOVA tables (type I and II are also available)
- Provides an anova-like table for random-effects based on likelihood-ratio tests
- A `step` function implements automatic model selection

## Discovered a bug?

Please raise a new issue! Preferably add code that illustrates the problem using one of the datasets from the **lmerTest**.

## Installation

Basically there are two options for installing **lmerTest**:

1. Released (stable version) from CRAN: in **R** run `install.packages("lmerTest")`.
2. Development version from GitHub: First load the **devtools** package (and install it if you do not have it) and install the default (master) branch:
```
library("devtools")
install_github("runehaubo/lmerTest")
```
If you haven't already installed a previous version of **lmerTest** you need to also install dependencies (other packages that **lmerTest** depends on and requires you to install to function properly). We recommend that you install **lmerTest** from CRAN (using `install.packages("lmerTest")`) before installing from GitHub as described above. 

An alternative is to use 
```
library("devtools")
install_github("runehaubo/lmerTest", dependencies=TRUE)
```
but that requires you to install all dependent packages from source (which only works if you have the correct compilers installed and set up correctly); installing the pre-compiled packages from CRAN is usually easier.
