Description: Different kinds of tests for linear mixed effects models as implemented
    in 'lme4' package are provided. The tests comprise types I - III F tests
    for fixed effects, LR tests for random effects.
    The package also provides the calculation of population means for fixed factors
    with confidence intervals  and corresponding plots. Finally the backward
    elimination of non-significant effects is implemented.
